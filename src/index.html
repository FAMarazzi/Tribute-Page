            <div class="timeline">
			<ul class="font">
				<br>
				<li><b>1912</b> - Alan Mathison Turing was born on June 23, 1912 in Maida Vale, London.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>1926</b> - At the age of 13, Alan Turing first showed signs of intelligence and potential which was noticed at the Sherborne School.                </li>
				<br>
				<li><b>1931</b> - Alan Turing studied from 1931 to 1934 at King's College, in Cambridge. He was first in his class and was an honor student in the field of mathematics.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>1936</b> - Turing studied mathematics and cryptology while also building three of four stages of an electro-mechanical binary multiplier at Princeton University.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>1939</b> - Turing helped to solve the essential part of the German naval indicator system and also came up with the idea of sequential analysis.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>1940</b> - Turing was responsible for creating the Bombe which was a cryptanalytic machine used to decrypt the Enigma-enciphered messages being sent from the enemies.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>1942</b> - Turing traveled to the United States to work with the US naval cryptanalysts to create their version of the Bombe and an Enigma in Washington.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>1946</b> - He presented his paper in February of 1946 where he had presented the first detailed design of a stored program computer setup.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>1947</b> - Turing lived in Hampton, London where worked on the design of the ACE (Automatic Computing Engine).</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>1948</b> - Turing created the LU decomposition method that was used and is still used today to solve matrix equations. <br>He was also appointed a position in the mathematics department at the University of Manchester where he worked on software for one of the earliest stored-program computers.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>1950</b> - The turing test was created in 1950. The turing test was created to compare the intelligence of a machine/computer to the intelligence of a human brain.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>1954</b> - Turing committed suicide in his house where his housekeeper found him dead.</li>
